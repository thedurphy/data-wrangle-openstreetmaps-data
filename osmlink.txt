For this project I have chosen my home area Minneapolis, MN.  The reason is to be better able to validate the data by cross-referencing the data with personal knowledge of the area.  The area is mainly Minneapolis, MN with some of the suburbs including New Brighton, Hopkins, and Minneapolisâ€™ Twin City, St. Paul.  Here is a link to the Overpass API for downloading the OSM for the region.
